# VBA-challenge

This project evaluates and presents the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume of a wide array of stocks from 2014 through 2016. Each year also has a table illustrating which stock had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest annual stock volume. The data was in the format of an excel workbook, and I used VBA scripting to loop through each worksheet and perform the above mentioned analysis.
